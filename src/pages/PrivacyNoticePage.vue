              <p>
                We use Cloudflare Web Analytics to understand how the site is used. Cloudflare Web
                Analytics does not use cookies and provides only aggregated metrics such as page

              <p>
                Cloudflare is the only third party that receives analytics information. Their
                service logs aggregate data without identifying individual visitors. We do not sell
                or rent any data.

                You can block analytics by using browser tracking protection or by filtering
                requests to Cloudflareâ€™s analytics endpoint. Doing so will not affect your ability
                to use the Service.
